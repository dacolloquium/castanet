Description = "This talk introduces the theoretical and applied foundations of Bayesian statistical analysis in a manner appropriate to social and behavioral scientists The Bayesian paradigm is ideally suited to the type of data analysis required in these fields because it recognizes the mobility of population parameters, ncorporates prior knowledge that researchers possess, and updates estimates as new data are observed. Examples will be drawn from political science, public policy, and anthropology.  Issues in Bayesian computing will also be discussed."
